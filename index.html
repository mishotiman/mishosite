        <p>Welcome to my webpage! My name is Michail Timanov, or just Misho, and I am a student in 12th grade. I first got started with HTML and CSS styling back in 9th grade, 3 years ago. That was when my interest towards coding sparked. I enjoy creating various websites with different designs. Styling could be considered as my favorite part in every project! Feel free to go around and take a look at my blog!</p>
